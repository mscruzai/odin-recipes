    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This espresso martini is a sweet and delicious after-dinner drink made with espresso, coffee liqueur, vodka, and white creme de cacao for a coffee lovers dream cocktail.</p>
    <p>A vodka martini is a vodka cocktail made with espresso and coffee liqueur. The drink originated in the 1980s and experienced a surge in popularity in the 2020s. The act of shaking the espresso with the ice, liquor, and liqueurs creates a creamy, foamy topping. </p>
